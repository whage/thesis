# TODO
- Xavier Leroy's publications
    - https://xavierleroy.org/research.html
        - this site is a GOLD MINE of information on type systems!!!
- Chris Lattner's PhD thesis: "LLVM: An Infrastructure for Multi-Stage Optimization" http://llvm.org/pubs/2002-12-LattnerMSThesis.html
- my good old bookmarked page: http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/
- http://canonical.org/~kragen/memory-models/
- there are some nice references in [Vorobyov], check them out!
    - D EUTSCH , A.: Static verification of dynamic properties. for example
- "Software Foundations" books by Penn
    - https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/index.html
- learn basic OCaml / Haskell to really get a feel for their type systems

# QUESTIONS
- wikipedia links? shall I include them?
- how to properly reference online content (articles, blog posts) ?
- what errors are NOT type errors?

# Research motivation
google this !!: "Static vs. dynamic type systems: an empirical study about the relationship between type casts and development time pdf"
    - so many pdf results!
