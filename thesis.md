    - maybe try it for HCL (Terraform)?

# Introduction, personal motivation
I first experienced working with staticly typed languages at the university.
After I started learning and working with C# I was struck by how much the
type system aided my development and how much the typechecker speeded up my work.
The type system made me think more thoroughly,
it allowed me to change parts of the program and be confident that I didn't break it.
It felt like a much more pleasant way of writing software than I had done before so I became
more and more interested in the possibilities of static checking and type systems.
I started wondering what else was out there that could boost programmer productivity
and software quality even further. This is how I chose type systems as the topic of my thesis.

My goal with this thesis is to gain a more fundamental understanding of programming languages,
the structures and algorithms behind them.
First, I'll survey the history and theoretical background of type systems.
I'll look at how type systems evolved, and how they could be categorized.
I'll compare the type systems of widely used programming languages and will try to
give an overview of the possibilites of recent advances in type systems and programming language design.

A type system is a set of rules that associate a property called a **type** to various constructs in a computer program.
A type defines a range of values as well as possible operations on instances of that type.
The main purpose of type systems is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer programs.
The type system associates a type with each value in the program and then by examining the flow of these values
attempts to prove that no operation violates them.

Such a violation is called a **type error**. It is an inconsistency in a program according to the type system's rules.
Exactly what constitutes a type error is defined by the type system of the language.
A program that violates the rules of its type system is often called ill typed. A program that conforms
to the rules of the language's type system is a well typed program.

Languages where variables can be given (nontrivial) types are called typed languages.
Languages that don't restrict the range of variables are called untyped languages. In these languages, invalid operations
might be applied to values which could result in a fixed value, a fault, an exception or an unspecified effect.

Typed languages can enforce good behavior by performing static (i.e. compile time) checks to prevent ill typed
programs from ever running. Untyped languages can enforce good behavior by performing sufficiently detailed
runtime checks to rule out errors. For example, they may check array bounds or division operations and generate
recoverable exceptions. This checking process during runtime is called dynamic checking.

**my own**
By using the facilities provided by the type system, we can add more information in our programs. We create a
safety-net against execution errors by making it possible for automated tools to verify our programs.

# The history of type systems
The first type systems appeared in the 1950s, when the desiners of the Fortran language wanted to make
numerical computations more efficient by distinguishing between integer-valued arithmetic expressions
and real-valued ones. This allowed the compiler to generate the appropriate machine instruction making the
program more efficient.

As [@pierce-types-and-prog] puts it, the abstraction of a safe language can be used "abstractly", whereas in an unsafe language
it is necessary to keep in mind the low level details, like how data is structured in memory or how allocations take place
in order to understand how the program might misbehave.

Note that "language safety" can be achieved by static type checking but also by run-time checks, like array-bounds checking is
performed by many languages during runtime.

[@cardelli-96] differentiates between _trapped errors_, that cause execution to stop immadiately and
_untrapped errors_ that go unnoticed and later cause arbitrary behaviour. An untrapped error, for example, is
accessing data past the end of an array in absence of run time bounds checks. A trapped error would be division
by zero or accessing an illegal address.
He calls languages where untrapped errors are impossible _safe languages_.

# Type checking
Type checking is the process of verifying that the constraints posed by the type system are not violated
by the program. Type checking can be done by automated tools called the typecheckers, which are usually
built into compilers or linkers.

http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2015/course/DAT150/lectures/proglang-07.html

## Static type checking
Programmers make errors. Advanced programming languages should allow the automatic checking of inconsistencies
in programs. The most popular of these consistency checks is called static typing.
[@leroy-phd]

Static type systems help us detect programming errors even before we could run our programs.
It is not just the simple mistakes (like forgetting toconvert a string to a number) that can be caught by a type checker.
A language with a rich set of types offers the opportunity to encode complex information about structure in terms of types
but it requires attention and willingness from the programmer to make good use of the language's facilities.

Static type systems are "conservative", meaning that they sometimes reject programs that actually behave
well at run time. For example

```
if <complex test> then 5 else <type error>
```

will always be rejected as ill-typed even if `<complex test>` always evaluates to true, because
static analysis cannot deftermine that this is the case.

# Type systems and program performance

- type systems allowing certain compiler optimizations?
    -   https://xavierleroy.org/publi/intro-tic98.pdf

To generate efficient machine code, precise knowledge about the size of the data is required. This can be derived from
static type information - memory size and layout. Languages without static typing cannot be compiled as efficiently,
all data representations must fit a default size.

> In general, accurate type information at compile time leads to the
> application of the appropriate operations at run time without the need of expensive tests.
>
> [@cardelli-96, p. 6]

If a language's type system doesn't allow casts between incompatible pointer types, then those can't point to the
same location in memory which in turn guarantees that load/store operations through those pointers cannot interfere.
This allows the compiler to do more aggressive instruction scheduling.

Type information is also useful in the optimization of method dispatch in object-oriented languages.
[@leroy-intro-tic98]

> General method dispatch is an expensive operation, involving a run-time lookup of the code associated to the method in
